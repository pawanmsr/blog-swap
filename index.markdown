# Revamping

This is a temporary page for until I am done creating a mathematics and engineering focused blog [theme](https://github.com/pawanmsr/jekyll-bhautiki) that enables me to share more of my math-heavy articles, technical drawings, schematics and other engineering designs (along side the usual non technical essays and poetry that I have been sharing until now in my old blog).
